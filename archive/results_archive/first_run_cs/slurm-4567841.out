/mimer/NOBACKUP/groups/brainage/thesis_brainage/my_venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torchio/data/image.py:248: UserWarning: Using TorchIO images without a torchio.SubjectsLoader in PyTorch >= 2.3 might have unexpected consequences, e.g., the collated batches will be instances of torchio.Subject with 5D images. Replace your PyTorch DataLoader with a torchio.SubjectsLoader so that the collated batch becomes a dictionary, as expected. See https://github.com/TorchIO-project/torchio/issues/1179 for more context about this issue.
